## Channel Architecture 

Our community is an interdependent ecosystem, that spans across the internet and many time zones — and for a lot of folks seeing the channel directory in the left-hand panel can feel overwhelming. 

Scrolling down a thread in discord or falling down a rabbit hole on a new curiosity feels like taking walk in a new neighborhood on the internet.   

Like most cities, FWB has different pockets of cultures & scenes — from fashion, to design, to music, to degen, to mental health, to NFTs, degen, skincare, local food, filmmakers, and so much more. Every category is its own neighborhood, with more channels inside of it. Here is a guide to our neighborhoods…

*Welcome (Info Center)*

Think of this as a city center — all important announcements, support & help, inquiry to contribution, setting up customized notifications for events, and connecting your wallet (please only use the official collab.land bot in the #wallet-connect channel to do so)

*General (Downtown)*

Walk down our main street. Hang out at the shops. Check the calendar for the next cocktail party. Meet some new friends. Pick up the sunday paper for a short read.   

Our general folder feels like the place we congregate and make sense of the bigger picture. It’s the first layer of common ground, before we go deeper down the rabbithole of web3, art, and culture. 

*Governance (City Hall)*

This is where our city’s democracy convenes.  We draft proposals, friends help each other formalize their proposals, and we put all major community decisions up to an on-chain community vote.

This structure creates transparency & consensus amongst our subcommunities, neighborhoods, and interconnected teams. 
 
*Learning (University)*

POV: It’s your first day of school. You listen to a lecture that blows your mind and the kid next to you is mapping out crazy ideas on a napkin. You’re excited & overwhelmed. 

It’s easy to forget that this started as a group chat of creative people that knew little to nothing about web3, but are willing to ask questions, give answers, compare notes, and collaborate.   We’re all shaping web3 in the present tense. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or put yourself out there — we’re here to help each other. 

*Creative (Art Studio)*

Late nights bending pixels to our will, .wav links before it hits streaming, 3D renders, talks with some of your artist’s favorite artist, the latest curations & gallery spaces, raves, private screenings, and the first cuts of documentaries.

The culture of the art studio, outside of the studio. Art & collaboration is happening right in front of your very eyes.

*Tradong (Squad Wealth)*

Nerds, suits, degens — come one and all. Learn the ins and outs of defi, trading, and degen. Keep your eyes on the charts and understand the chaotic nature of market movements in crypto. Oh, and we’ve got some trad fi channels, for those who partake.

But remember, this is not financial advice.

*NFTS (The Arts District)*

One of the biggest subcultures in our little city is the NFT-General crew and one of our first sub-daos. Think of Art Basel, but online, for and by internet artists.

They curate, they consolidate the most interesting new projects in the space, they talk craft, and do deep dives into solidity. There’s something for everyone here, if you want to learn something new. 

*Lifestyle*

When we say “crypto is the least interesting thing about us” — this is where we hang out.

You are a combination of the five channels you spend the most time in.

Whether you want to spend time in the fashion district, the community garden, the movie theater, the library, the gym, or at home with your kids... we know a place. 

*Digital Events*

In an increasingly noisy world with so many distractions, this is where we come together to spend time together.  

Whether it’s a laidback call with your favorite dj or visual artist, a deep dive on solidity, wallet security 101, or an afternoon meditation... there’s something for everyone. 

*Cities*

FWB has established three Cities — London, New York, and Los Angeles — as the originating sub-DAOs within the FWB ecosystem, with more on the horizon.

These Cities have come together, elected their own leadership, and are building the blueprint for what FWB means on a local level.

From hosting local dinners to partnering with spaces and cafes as coworking spaces, to pooling capital to invest in local initiatives, the possibilities behind our Cities are endless.

We believe the strongest onramp into FWB is through participating in local community.

Additionally, the FWB Local tier will grant access to all FWB #cities channels, wherein members can connect with friends in their respective areas, whether they’re at home or traveling.

## Voice Chat Channels

Our Discord hosts very few, but very lively and active voice chats. Much of our planned programming in voice-chat falls under the ‘digital events’ designation. 

Fwb-voice-chat: This channel is often used for recurring digital events like: new member hang, town hall, MAX PAIN and coffee time. But, anyone can pop into this channel to hold a casual conversation and see who else will pop in. Anyone who joins this channel can just unmute themselves to speak. 

Fwb-main-stage: Stages in Discord are used for more structured voice events. You can indicate which speakers are on the ‘stage’ and they are the only ones who can speak within the channel. This channel is used for larger group discussions and more broadcast style talks. 

LA-voice, NYC-voice, LDN-voice: These voice chat channels were established as a part of our old cities program, allowing city leads to host location-specific town halls and more casual discussions
